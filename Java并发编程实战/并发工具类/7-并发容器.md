- ArrayList、HashSet、HashMap 不是线程安全的，如果变成线程安全的可以使用Collections.synchronizedList等方法完成
- 线程安全只保证单个操作是原子操作，但是组合操作不保证线程安全性
- 迭代之前得加锁

```java
 List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList());
      ...
  synchronized (list) {
      Iterator i = list.iterator(); // Must be in synchronized block
      while (i.hasNext())
          foo(i.next());
  }
```

- vector的效率比Collections的效率还高，基本是个废物

#### CopyOnWriteArrayList

> A thread-safe variant of [`ArrayList`](../../../java/util/ArrayList.html) in which all mutative operations (`add`, `set`, and so on) are implemented by making a fresh copy of the underlying array.
>
> This is ordinarily too costly, but may be *more* efficient than alternatives when traversal operations vastly outnumber mutations, and is useful when you cannot or don't want to synchronize traversals, yet need to preclude interference among concurrent threads. The "snapshot" style iterator method uses a reference to the state of the array at the point that the iterator was created. This array never changes during the lifetime of the iterator, so interference is impossible and the iterator is guaranteed not to throw `ConcurrentModificationException`. The iterator will not reflect additions, removals, or changes to the list since the iterator was created. Element-changing operations on iterators themselves (`remove`, `set`, and `add`) are not supported. These methods throw `UnsupportedOperationException`.

> All elements are permitted, including `null`.

> Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a `CopyOnWriteArrayList` [*happen-before*](package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility) actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from the `CopyOnWriteArrayList` in another thread.

- all mutative operations 所有会引起修改的操作
- making a fresh copy of the underlying array 会在ArrayList的底层数组进行一个拷贝
- This is ordinarily too costly。 花费巨大
- "snapshot" style 迭代遍历使用的是快照
- 迭代遍历只读

主要是CopyOnWrite

这个类似于MySQL的可重复读隔离状态，读是快照，写是copy过去一份备份，在备份上写，写完了之后，再完成切换，这样读就是完全无锁的。

- 所有的写操作都需要拷贝一个备份，这耗费巨大
- 需要允许不一致的状态

读远高于写的场景适合s
